# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## OVERVIEW
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its properties. Using Wine Quality Dataset, the project explores data preprocessing, feature selection and model building with algorithms such as KNN, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Then evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the food and beverage industry for quality assessment and decision support.
